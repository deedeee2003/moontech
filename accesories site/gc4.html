                        Package Contents
                        1x TTRacing Swift X 2020 Gaming Chair

                        Built for Dominance
                        Swift X 2020 aims to bring your seating experience to the next level. Being the perfect size 
                        for those looking for something bigger than Duo V3 but shorter than the Surge. The Swift X 
                        2020 model features a wider lumbar and shoulder support with an enclosing curvature that 
                        ensures correct position all the time. It is built ergonomically, ensuring perfect contact 
                        between user’s body and the chair. Equal body weight distribution made inch perfect when 
                        ergonomic design meets our soft and thick cold cure foam, attached to the highest quality 
                        faux leather and meticulously embedded onto the Swift X 2020. 

                        165 Degree Full Recline
                        The Swift X comes with a 165 degree recline that gives extra stability with maximum comfort. 
                        This can be very handy especially when you want to be in a more relax position after a long 
                        day. With this feature, just lay back while you enjoy the best football match or movie that 
                        you have been waiting for!

                        The Art of Perfect Craftsmanship
                        Advanced craftsmanship ability has allowed us to create a seamless cover for our chair body. 
                        Traditionally, foam is applied to a chair frame before skin is applied onto the foam. The 
                        process is much simpler, however, creating potential uneven surface and creases. 

                        At TTRacing, compromising on quality is not an option. We combined our top quality cold 
                        cure foam with our premium faux leather, before applying onto the chair frame. This 
                        orientation results in impeccable fit between foam, skin and the frame, eliminating even 
                        trivial creases. Bonded faux leather is also more practical (as compared to hot real leather 
                        chairs) and provide the best value for quality. 

                        Lifetime Warranty Steel Frame Structure
                        As good as it sounds, the Swift X 2020 model features reinvented, sturdier and thicker steel 
                        tubes that are used to construct the entire steel frame. Padding on the Swift X 2020 is made 
                        of high density cold cure foam which provide great support over long hours while keeping 
                        you comfortable. You can expect great amount of comfort over extended period of usage 
                        time with such combination of industry leading materials.

                        Height Adjustable Armrest
                        Through vigorous R&D, the height adjustable armrest is the proprietary armrests designed 
                        to provide the best adjustments and comfort level. Featuring a longer and wider area, it will 
                        be most likely to cover any average body from wrist level down to the elbow. With about 
                        8cm height adjustments to make, it is by far the best to seek anywhere. Our armrests are 
                        fully coated with the softest PU and cushion body material, coupled with great grip on both 
                        sides to provide you a special place for your arms.
